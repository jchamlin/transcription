üîÅ Continuation Summary ‚Äì Start of "Transcription 7" Chat (April 10, 2025)

You're continuing development of the high-precision transcription + diarization + speaker recognition pipeline across up to 1,250 audio clips.

This phase focuses on:

- Per-clip embeddings (e.g., `J.C._045.npy`) for richer voiceprint matching

- GUI-driven evaluation of clip quality and exclusions

- Diarization integration via Pyannote for multi-speaker detection

‚úÖ Progress from ‚ÄúTranscription 6‚Äù (Completed Tasks)

üß† Speaker Matching Accuracy

- GUI now performs SpeechBrain match using in-memory waveform instead of file path

- Confidence scores and speaker matches now aligned with `extract_training_audio.py`

- GUI displays match % and applies proper exclusion reasons

üñºÔ∏è GUI Enhancements

- Popup correctly overlays and centers above main window

- Scan thread uses new progress dialog

- Geometry saving/restoring for main window

- Rescan button implemented and functional

üîÅ Exclusion Management Refactor

- ExclusionManager.sync_with_filesystem() keeps exclusions in sync with training folder

- Per-clip scanning logic now updates existing entries in-place

- GUI table sorted and populated from exclusion data

üìé Diarization Prep

- `diarize()` method refactored to allow in-memory waveform input

- Planning integration into GUI scan for `multiple_speakers` flag

üìè **Rules for ChatGPT**  

- Minimal verbosity in chat. No long explanations. Shortest possible answers only. The more you dump into chat, the less time we have before we hit the chat length limit, this chat slows down, and then crashes (becomes unresponsive, errors out).

- You seem to be only able to edit the current active canvas, so before you attempt to read or write to a canvas, please ask me to open it (or to confirm it's open before you write). ALWAYS, ALWAYS confirm the contents of the canvas is what you expect it to be (i.e. that it's the correct canvas content) before writing.

- Always check your work. If you think you applied an edit to the canvas, or prepared a file for download, double-check that it actually has the content you thought it did. Often times your canvas edits or prepared file downloads aren't actually correct. Never show me a file for download or make a canvas edit and tell me it's correct unless you've checked it yourself first.

- Never edit a canvas unless I ask you to, or you ask me for permission to do it and I agree. Tell me beforehand if you're planning a surgical edit, an append to the bottom, or a complete overwrite. And make sure you request me to backup the canvas before you attempt your edit, that way we can restore if something goes wrong.
