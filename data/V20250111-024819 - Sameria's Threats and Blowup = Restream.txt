Hello, Sassa. You didn't get ready. What do you mean? Oh. About it.

You're not locked. I don't care. Why are you slamming the door in my face? I was in a slow down. Why are you behaving like a spoiled brat that didn't get her way?

Running off and slamming doors and restroom. That's why you slammed the door on my face? It just left my hand. Both of my arms. Why would you close the door on me in the first place?

If I wanted to slam the door and close the door and, quote unquote, lock the door, I would have just opened it, reopened it. Why wouldn't you say, honey, I love you, but I have to go to the bathroom? I got you. Okay. Because you don't.

I know. And you don't wanna fake it anymore. I get it. You don't wanna have sex with me. Never said I didn't wanna have sex with you.

You're right. I answered. We should already answer to you, and I said nothing. So nothing. So leave me alone and let me live my life.

Connecting, you have to have those things first. So you connected with Jace. It's like, nothing to do with me. I should have bored it. That's That's what you said.

No. I said if we get if, like, we decide to, like, part ways and divorce, you said you'd abort it. Whole reaction. I don't treat you like a backup. And we have I get you right.

And and to confide in so that we're looking at it. I didn't do that. I'm just letting you know that's very narcissistic behavior. I didn't do that. What if it's what if it's somebody that you'll have never met and you and you never will meet?

I'm just saying. I'm just saying. What if it's someone that you have never met and will meet? Even at the wedding I don't need you to stop. Okay?

Why? Me being honest, like, this whole thing, you need to stop. I'm being honest. You said this was safe space. Let me talk and be honest.

You said that you're gonna share with this friend, and I said I'm probably gonna be embarrassed and probably walk away. Mhmm. That's me being upfront and honest. This is not being upfront and honest. Yes.

It is. This is you being mean. I'm not being mean. Yes. You are.

I am. Okay? Wake up. I am. I am awake.

Wake up. I said I wasn't threatening you. You said this was a safe space, that I can talk about this. And then you asked me, why don't you trust me? Why don't you show me that you love me?

Why don't you do this? Why don't you do that? And then you you have all these words and these terms and these oh my god. Can we be humans with feelings for once? You can't.

Because you push me away. And then I ask you, hey. Are you still are you and then you do these slight little terms of hooker, tram, and this and that. And no. I can't have sex with that without feelings.

And of course I I walk into the you follow me into the like, dude. It's nice you're moving on to the next step, threat. Yeah. You're fucked up. Sleep with that.

You are. That's you. Right? I'm not looking at attorneys. I have I have been so content.

I have kept my fucking cool. And for you to say that I'm threatening you, I haven't I haven't even done a single thing to even say, oh yeah, I'm about to divorce you. I'm trying not to be my ass. I'm trying to look for at least some apartment so that I'm not on my ass and you're talking about me threatening you when you're telling me that you're gonna I should probably tell someone since you told your friends. I'm I should probably tell someone.

You're the one threatening me. I'm talking about that. You're the one threatening me to tell your friends that I cheated on you. Go ahead. In fact, matter of fact, let's post about it.

Let's make a whole post on Facebook about it and stop sending me requests about saying the fact that we're married on Facebook. Stop with that because you're so fucking two faced. You do one thing and then you do the other. Oh, thank nice nice nice that you're threatening me and then you go on Facebook and you wanna say you're married to me. But oh, you don't have sex with me.

But oh, you you think I'm comparing you to other sex partners. But oh, you wanna talk to Kitty but at the same time you feel like we're not on the same page or the same team. Like, make up your mind. It is so frustrating. I'm trying to give you space.

I'm trying to be like, I can't even touch you. I can't even look at you because you are so sad all the time. Who did that to me? I did. Yeah.

And, like, you always are so, like, oh, we're not on the same team. Oh, we're getting a divorce. Oh, we don't have cat. Oh, like, dude. I I never said we're getting a divorce.

You said that. Mhmm. Yeah. You said that. I didn't say we're getting a divorce.

You said we're moving towards getting a divorce. That's what you said. I said we're heading in that direction. Yes. Yeah.

So and now you're talking about threats. What I literally said, I feel like if you were to tell people, I probably would move toward a worse way, I would be I would be embarrassed. That's what I said. That's not a threat. And you said that I'm moving to the and you said that I'm the one who's moving the next step in the teacher's playbook to to threats.
