[00:00.00 - 00:07.00] J.C. (11% match): Oh that was fast, you didn't get ready.
[00:07.00 - 00:08.00] Sameria (100% match): What do you mean?
[01:00.00 - 01:12.00] Sameria (6% match): Wait, let me put this in.
[01:12.00 - 01:21.00] Sameria (8% match): Oh.
[01:21.00 - 01:35.00] Sameria (2% match): I got it.
[01:35.00 - 01:36.00] Sameria (0% match): You're not locked.
[01:36.00 - 01:39.00] J.C. (27% match): I don't care, why are you slamming the door in my face?
[01:39.00 - 01:40.00] Sameria (64% match): It wasn't a slam.
[01:40.00 - 01:45.00] J.C. (43% match): Why are you behaving like a spoiled brat that didn't get her way?
[01:45.00 - 01:47.00] J.C. (100% match): Running off and slamming doors and...
[01:47.00 - 01:49.00] Sameria (100% match): I had to use the restroom, that's it.
[01:49.00 - 01:51.00] J.C. (78% match): That's why you slammed the door in my face?
[01:51.00 - 01:53.00] Sameria (1% match): It just slipped from my hand and both of my arms were...
[01:53.00 - 01:55.00] J.C. (87% match): Why would you close the door on me in the first place?
[01:55.00 - 02:01.00] Sameria (99% match): If I wanted to slam the door and close the door and quote unquote lock the door, I would have just opened it, re-opened it.
[02:01.00 - 02:05.00] J.C. (94% match): Why wouldn't you say, honey I love you but I have to go to the bathroom?
[02:05.00 - 02:07.00] Sameria (10% match): I have to, okay.
[02:07.00 - 02:09.00] J.C. (73% match): Because you don't, I know.
[02:09.00 - 02:12.00] J.C. (91% match): And you don't want to fake it anymore, I get it.
[02:12.00 - 02:14.00] Sameria (91% match): You don't want to have sex with me and...
[02:14.00 - 02:16.00] J.C. (94% match): I never said I didn't want to have sex with you.
[02:32.00 - 02:38.00] Sameria (93% match): The right way to have sex and what needs to be in place, but I answered all the questions already, so...
[02:38.00 - 02:40.00] J.C. (76% match): That's a real question, you didn't answer that one.
[02:40.00 - 02:43.00] Sameria (81% match): Everything you said is right, everything should be in place, you're right.
[02:43.00 - 02:44.00] Sameria (100% match): Therefore we should not...
[02:44.00 - 02:46.00] Sameria (100% match): I already answered you and I said nothing, so nothing.
[02:46.00 - 02:49.00] Sameria (100% match): So leave me alone and let me live my life.
[02:49.00 - 02:50.00] Sameria (25% match): Thank you.
[02:50.00 - 02:52.00] Sameria (78% match): Sorry that I asked.
[02:54.00 - 02:56.00] J.C. (65% match): Well, it was a little worrisome when I'm horny.
[02:56.00 - 02:57.00] J.C. (100% match): That's what you wanted to say.
[02:57.00 - 02:58.00] J.C. (100% match): Not anything about me.
[02:58.00 - 03:00.00] Sameria (58% match): That's not the right way to reconnect.
[03:00.00 - 03:01.00] Sameria (100% match): That's not the right way to connect.
[03:01.00 - 03:02.00] J.C. (100% match): You don't listen.
[03:02.00 - 03:05.00] Sameria (100% match): Don't you think connecting you have to have those things first?
[03:05.00 - 03:07.00] Sameria (100% match): So you connected with Jace.
[03:07.00 - 03:09.00] Sameria (100% match): Like, nothing to do with me, I should abort it.
[03:09.00 - 03:10.00] Sameria (100% match): That's what you said.
[03:10.00 - 03:15.00] J.C. (86% match): No, I said if we decide to part ways and divorce, you said you'd abort it.
[03:15.00 - 03:16.00] J.C. (100% match): Whole reaction.
[03:20.00 - 03:22.00] Sameria (59% match): I don't treat you like a back up.
[03:24.00 - 03:26.00] J.C. (54% match): And we have to get you right.
[03:26.00 - 03:28.00] Sameria (81% match): And to confide in so that we're looking like...
[03:28.00 - 03:29.00] Sameria (100% match): I didn't do that.
[03:29.00 - 03:32.00] J.C. (100% match): I'm just letting you know that's very narcissistic behavior.
[03:32.00 - 03:33.00] Sameria (57% match): I didn't do that.
[03:34.00 - 03:38.00] J.C. (83% match): What if it's somebody that you'll have never met and you never will meet?
[03:38.00 - 03:39.00] Sameria (96% match): I'm just saying.
[03:40.00 - 03:41.00] Sameria (100% match): I'm just saying.
[03:41.00 - 03:43.00] J.C. (80% match): What if it's someone that you have never met and will meet?
[03:46.00 - 03:47.00] J.C. (64% match): Even at the wedding?
[03:47.00 - 03:48.00] Sameria (100% match): I gonna need you to stop.
[03:49.00 - 03:50.00] Sameria (19% match): Okay?
[03:50.00 - 03:51.00] J.C. (15% match): Why?
[03:51.00 - 03:53.00] Sameria (72% match): Me being honest...
[03:53.00 - 03:56.00] Sameria (75% match): Like, this whole thing...
[03:57.00 - 03:58.00] Sameria (84% match): You need to stop.
[03:59.00 - 04:01.00] Sameria (73% match): I'm being honest.
[04:01.00 - 04:02.00] Sameria (100% match): You said this was a safe space.
[04:02.00 - 04:04.00] Sameria (100% match): Let me talk and be honest.
[04:04.00 - 04:07.00] Sameria (100% match): You said that you're going to share with this friend.
[04:07.00 - 04:11.00] Sameria (100% match): And I said I'm probably going to be embarrassed and probably walk away.
[04:13.00 - 04:15.00] Sameria (66% match): That's me being upfront and honest.
[04:15.00 - 04:17.00] J.C. (85% match): This is not being upfront and honest.
[04:17.00 - 04:18.00] Sameria (100% match): Yes it is.
[04:18.00 - 04:19.00] J.C. (100% match): This is you being mean.

[04:20.00 - 04:21.00] J.C. (62% match): Yes you are.
[04:21.00 - 04:24.00] Sameria (77% match): You telling me that I'm being...
[04:24.00 - 04:28.00] Sameria (99% match): You telling me that I have a playbook is fucked up.
[04:29.00 - 04:32.00] Sameria (76% match): The shit that you're reading is fucked up.
[04:32.00 - 04:34.00] J.C. (52% match): You're doing everything in it
