[01:36.600 - 01:38.840] SPEAKER_01 (36.16% match): I don't care, why are you slamming the door in my face?
[01:39.360 - 01:40.100] SPEAKER_04 (100.0% match): I was in a slam.
[01:40.120 - 01:42.160] SPEAKER_01 (100.0% match): Why are you behaving like a spoiled brat?
[01:43.280 - 01:44.360] SPEAKER_01 (100.0% match): That didn't get her way.
[01:45.180 - 01:47.440] SPEAKER_01 (100.0% match): Running off and slamming doors.
[01:47.740 - 01:48.560] SPEAKER_01 (100.0% match): I helped you with the restroom, that's good.

[01:51.300 - 01:52.800] SPEAKER_UNKNOWN (0.0% match): It just went through my hand.
[01:53.380 - 01:55.360] SPEAKER_01 (100.0% match): Why would you close the door on me in the first place?
[01:55.460 - 02:00.960] SPEAKER_04 (100.0% match): If I wanted to slam the door and close the door and lock the door, I would have just opened it, re-opened it.
[02:01.300 - 02:04.900] SPEAKER_01 (100.0% match): Why wouldn't you say, honey, I love you, but I have to go to the bathroom?
[02:05.040 - 02:06.020] SPEAKER_01 (17.35% match): I have to, okay.
[02:07.240 - 02:09.140] SPEAKER_01 (85.16% match): Because you don't, I know.

[02:13.620 - 02:16.620] SPEAKER_00 (100.0% match): You never said I didn't want to have sex with you.
[02:32.640 - 02:38.320] SPEAKER_02 (97.89% match): The right way to have sex and what needs to be in place, but I answered all the questions already, so.
[02:38.480 - 02:40.560] SPEAKER_01 (100.0% match): That's a real question, you didn't answer that one.
[02:40.560 - 02:43.780] SPEAKER_02 (99.91% match): Everything you said is right, everything should be in place, you're right.
[02:43.960 - 02:44.860] SPEAKER_02 (100.0% match): Therefore, we should not.
[02:44.900 - 02:46.940] SPEAKER_02 (100.0% match): I already answered you and I said nothing, so nothing.

[02:58.080 - 02:58.880] SPEAKER_01 (100.0% match): Not anything about me.
[02:58.920 - 02:59.880] SPEAKER_02 (100.0% match): That's not the right way to reconnect.
[03:00.260 - 03:01.660] SPEAKER_02 (100.0% match): That's not the right way to connect.
[03:01.880 - 03:02.480] SPEAKER_02 (100.0% match): You don't listen.
[03:02.480 - 03:05.320] SPEAKER_02 (100.0% match): Don't you think connecting, you have to have those things first.
[03:05.740 - 03:07.600] SPEAKER_02 (100.0% match): So you connected with Jace.
[03:07.600 - 03:09.960] SPEAKER_02 (100.0% match): Nothing to do with me, I should abort it.
[03:10.000 - 03:10.620] SPEAKER_02 (100.0% match): That's what you said.
[03:10.980 - 03:16.140] SPEAKER_01 (100.0% match): No, I said if we decide to part ways and divorce, you said you'd abort it.
[03:16.180 - 03:17.020] SPEAKER_01 (89.05% match): Full reaction.
[03:20.840 - 03:22.600] SPEAKER_02 (75.97% match): I don't treat you like a back up.
[03:25.160 - 03:26.600] SPEAKER_01 (100.0% match): And we have to get you right.
[03:27.280 - 03:29.100] SPEAKER_02 (100.0% match): And to confide in so that we're with you.
[03:29.120 - 03:29.900] SPEAKER_02 (100.0% match): I didn't do that.
[03:29.980 - 03:32.240] SPEAKER_01 (100.0% match): I'm just letting you know, that's very narcissistic behavior.
[03:32.860 - 03:33.880] SPEAKER_02 (77.65% match): I didn't do that.
[03:34.560 - 03:38.900] SPEAKER_01 (98.0% match): What if it's somebody that you'll have never met and you never will meet?

[03:46.440 - 03:46.960] SPEAKER_01 (100.0% match): Even at the wedding?
[03:46.980 - 03:48.180] SPEAKER_03 (97.25% match): I don't need you to stop.
[03:49.680 - 03:49.980] SPEAKER_04 (59.67% match): Okay?
[03:51.120 - 03:51.360] SPEAKER_01 (100.0% match): Why?
[03:51.480 - 03:58.120] SPEAKER_04 (98.86% match): Me being honest, like this whole thing, you need to stop.

[04:13.460 - 04:15.140] SPEAKER_04 (86.96% match): That's me being upfront and honest.
[04:15.600 - 04:16.880] SPEAKER_01 (100.0% match): This is not being upfront and honest.
[04:16.960 - 04:17.860] SPEAKER_01 (100.0% match): Yes it is.
[04:18.000 - 04:18.880] SPEAKER_01 (100.0% match): This is you being mean.

[05:30.340 - 05:31.400] SPEAKER_04 (100.0% match): Why don't you do this?
[05:31.620 - 05:32.720] SPEAKER_04 (100.0% match): Why don't you do that?
[05:32.900 - 05:36.180] SPEAKER_04 (100.0% match): And then you have all these words and these terms and these...
[05:36.180 - 05:37.440] SPEAKER_04 (100.0% match): Oh my God.

[06:33.420 - 06:34.100] SPEAKER_04 (100.0% match): If I was...
[06:34.100 - 06:34.920] SPEAKER_04 (100.0% match): I'm saying that I'm probably...
[06:34.920 - 06:35.780] SPEAKER_04 (100.0% match): You even said it.
[06:35.800 - 06:39.700] SPEAKER_04 (100.0% match): You're like, people are just going to look at you like you're bad and that they're probably
[06:39.700 - 06:41.740] SPEAKER_04 (100.0% match): not going to like you anymore, and this and that.
[06:42.000 - 06:43.280] SPEAKER_04 (100.0% match): And I'm like, yeah, you're probably right.
[06:43.300 - 06:48.120] SPEAKER_04 (100.0% match): So I'm saying, with embarrassment, I'm probably going to probably flee towards divorce.
[06:49.540 - 06:50.240] SPEAKER_04 (100.0% match): That's human.
[06:50.340 - 06:51.080] SPEAKER_04 (100.0% match): That's normal.
[06:51.080 - 06:52.940] SPEAKER_01 (47.2% match): No, it's not.
[06:52.940 - 06:54.720] SPEAKER_04 (90.22% match): And I'm sharing my feelings with you.
[06:54.740 - 06:55.140] SPEAKER_04 (100.0% match): Facing what you did.
[06:55.140 - 06:56.840] SPEAKER_04 (100.0% match): And you're saying that I'm threatening you?
[06:57.560 - 06:59.100] SPEAKER_04 (100.0% match): I'm not the one looking at attorneys.
[06:59.100 - 06:59.820] SPEAKER_04 (100.0% match): You are.
[06:59.980 - 07:00.980] SPEAKER_01 (100.0% match): You're yelling at me.
[07:01.060 - 07:02.380] SPEAKER_01 (100.0% match): You're looming over me.

[07:04.640 - 07:05.320] SPEAKER_04 (100.0% match): You are.
[07:05.460 - 07:06.500] SPEAKER_04 (100.0% match): That's you, right?
[07:06.520 - 07:07.660] SPEAKER_02 (100.0% match): I'm not looking at attorneys.
[07:07.720 - 07:11.980] SPEAKER_04 (96.24% match): Because I have been so content.
[07:12.220 - 07:13.920] SPEAKER_04 (100.0% match): I have kept my fucking cool.
[07:14.300 - 07:16.380] SPEAKER_04 (100.0% match): And for you to say that I'm threatening you?
[07:16.380 - 07:23.740] SPEAKER_04 (100.0% match): I haven't even done a single thing to even say, oh yeah, I'm about to divorce you.
[07:23.960 - 07:25.300] SPEAKER_04 (100.0% match): I'm trying not to be in my ass.
[07:25.340 - 07:30.360] SPEAKER_04 (100.0% match): I'm trying to look for at least some apartment so that I'm not out on my ass.
[07:30.640 - 07:32.660] SPEAKER_04 (100.0% match): And you're talking about me threatening you?
[07:33.020 - 07:35.120] SPEAKER_04 (100.0% match): When you're telling me that you're going to...
[07:35.120 - 07:38.220] SPEAKER_04 (100.0% match): I should probably tell someone since you told your friends.
[07:38.400 - 07:39.400] SPEAKER_04 (100.0% match): I should probably tell someone.
[07:39.940 - 07:41.680] SPEAKER_04 (100.0% match): You're the one threatening me.
[07:42.000 - 07:45.380] SPEAKER_04 (100.0% match): You're the one threatening me to tell your friends that I cheated on you.
[07:45.380 - 07:45.940] SPEAKER_04 (100.0% match): Go ahead.
[07:46.060 - 07:48.200] SPEAKER_04 (100.0% match): In fact, matter of fact, let's post about it.
[07:48.300 - 07:50.420] SPEAKER_04 (100.0% match): Let's make a whole post on Facebook about it.
[07:50.480 - 07:54.900] SPEAKER_04 (100.0% match): And stop sending me requests about saying the fact that we're married on Facebook.
[07:55.200 - 07:56.040] SPEAKER_04 (100.0% match): Stop with that.
[07:56.240 - 07:58.160] SPEAKER_04 (100.0% match): Because you're so fucking two-faced.
[07:58.380 - 08:00.160] SPEAKER_04 (100.0% match): You do one thing and then you do the other.
[08:00.760 - 08:03.960] SPEAKER_04 (100.0% match): Oh, nice, nice, nice that you're threatening me.
[08:04.180 - 08:06.620] SPEAKER_04 (100.0% match): And then you go on Facebook and you want to say you're married to me.
