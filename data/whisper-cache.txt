[00:05.940 - 00:07.500]: I thought that was fast, you didn't get ready.
[00:07.800 - 00:08.440]: What do you mean?
[00:57.180 - 00:59.980]: What do you mean?
[01:07.000 - 01:12.040]: Wait, let me put this in.
[01:12.540 - 01:13.100]: Oh.
[01:19.880 - 01:22.120]: I got it.
[01:35.080 - 01:36.140]: You're not locked.
[01:36.600 - 01:38.840]: I don't care, why are you slamming the door in my face?
[01:39.360 - 01:40.100]: I was in a slam.
[01:40.120 - 01:44.420]: Why are you behaving like a spoiled brat that didn't get her way?
[01:45.180 - 01:47.440]: Running off and slamming doors.
[01:47.740 - 01:48.560]: I helped you with the restroom, that's good.
[01:49.080 - 01:50.420]: That's why you slammed the door in my face?
[01:51.300 - 01:52.800]: It just went through my hand.
[01:53.380 - 01:55.360]: Why would you close the door on me in the first place?
[01:55.460 - 02:00.960]: If I wanted to slam the door and close the door and lock the door, I would have just opened it, re-opened it.
[02:01.300 - 02:04.900]: Why wouldn't you say, honey, I love you, but I have to go to the bathroom?
[02:05.040 - 02:06.020]: I have to, okay.
[02:07.240 - 02:09.140]: Because you don't, I know.
[02:09.840 - 02:11.960]: And you don't want to fake it anymore, I get it.
[02:11.980 - 02:13.620]: You don't want to have sex with me.
[02:13.620 - 02:19.780]: You never said I didn't want to have sex with you.
[02:23.880 - 02:29.620]: Oh, not.
[02:32.320 - 02:38.240]: The right way to have sex and what needs to be in place, but I answered all the questions already, so.
[02:38.480 - 02:40.560]: That's a real question, you didn't answer that one.
[02:40.560 - 02:43.780]: Everything you said is right, everything should be in place, you're right.
[02:43.960 - 02:44.860]: Therefore, we should not.
[02:44.900 - 02:46.940]: I already answered you and I said nothing, so nothing.
[02:47.380 - 02:49.420]: So leave me alone and let me live my life.
[02:50.500 - 02:51.020]: Thank you.
[02:51.140 - 02:52.580]: Sorry that I asked.
[02:54.800 - 02:56.220]: Well, it was a little worrisome when I'm horny.
[02:56.580 - 02:57.340]: That's what you wanted to say.
[02:58.080 - 02:58.880]: Not anything about me.
[02:58.920 - 03:01.660]: That's not the right way to reconnect, that's not the right way to connect.
[03:01.880 - 03:02.480]: You don't listen.
[03:02.480 - 03:05.320]: Don't you think connecting, you have to have those things first?
[03:05.760 - 03:07.600]: So you connected with Jace.
[03:07.940 - 03:09.940]: Nothing to do with me, I should have bored it.
[03:09.940 - 03:10.600]: That's what you said.
[03:10.860 - 03:16.120]: No, I said if we decided to part ways and divorce, you said you'd have bored it.
[03:16.120 - 03:16.940]: Triple reaction.
[03:20.480 - 03:23.360]: I don't treat you like a back up.
[03:25.000 - 03:26.560]: And we have to get you right.
[03:27.300 - 03:29.100]: And to confide in so that we're looking good.
[03:29.120 - 03:29.900]: I didn't do that.
[03:29.940 - 03:32.220]: I'm just letting you know that's very narcissistic behavior.
[03:32.860 - 03:33.940]: I didn't do that.
[03:34.940 - 03:38.880]: What if it's somebody that you'll have never met and you never will meet?
[03:38.880 - 03:39.920]: I'm just saying.
[03:40.480 - 03:41.240]: I'm just saying.
[03:41.440 - 03:43.660]: What if it's someone that you have never met and will meet?
[03:46.180 - 03:46.980]: Even at the wedding?
[03:46.980 - 03:48.220]: I'm going to need you to stop.
[03:49.640 - 03:50.020]: Okay?
[03:51.200 - 03:58.140]: Me being honest, like this whole thing, you need to stop.
[03:59.520 - 04:00.740]: I'm being honest.
[04:01.400 - 04:02.540]: You said this was a safe space.
[04:02.980 - 04:04.200]: Let me talk and be honest.
[04:04.880 - 04:07.380]: You said that you're going to share with this friend.
[04:07.380 - 04:12.160]: And I said I'm probably going to be embarrassed and probably walk away.
[04:13.440 - 04:15.080]: That's me being upfront and honest.
[04:15.580 - 04:16.880]: This is not being upfront and honest.
[04:16.960 - 04:17.860]: Yes, it is.
[04:17.980 - 04:18.880]: This is you being mean.
[04:19.100 - 04:20.160]: I'm not being mean.
[04:20.460 - 04:21.360]: Yes, you are.
[04:22.420 - 04:27.960]: You telling me that I'm being, you telling me that I have a playbook is fucked up.
[04:29.740 - 04:32.740]: The shit that you're reading is fucked up.
[04:33.100 - 04:34.880]: This is real life.
[04:34.880 - 04:36.100]: I don't care if you've read it.
[04:36.100 - 04:37.200]: This is real life.
[04:37.200 - 04:38.440]: This is real life.
[04:38.440 - 04:39.660]: You're doing everything from it.
[04:40.040 - 04:41.060]: This is real life.
[04:41.260 - 04:42.460]: This is real life.
[04:42.460 - 04:42.480]: This is real life.
[04:42.520 - 04:43.540]: This is not no game.
[04:44.040 - 04:47.640]: Those stories you're reading, this is actually a marriage.
[04:48.240 - 04:49.180]: Wake up.
[04:49.180 - 04:49.920]: You're in the playbook.
[04:49.920 - 04:50.780]: Wake up.
[04:51.080 - 04:51.800]: Wake up.
[04:52.080 - 04:53.120]: I'm tired.
[04:54.120 - 04:55.740]: You have a name for everything.
[04:56.340 - 04:58.000]: I'm sick and tired.
[04:59.840 - 05:02.920]: I'm not going to sit here and have you have a name for everything.
[05:03.860 - 05:04.300]: Gaslighting.
[05:04.700 - 05:05.140]: Manipulation.
[05:05.340 - 05:07.140]: This and that.
[05:08.620 - 05:09.620]: You knew those terms before.
[05:09.620 - 05:11.180]: I don't give a fuck.
[05:12.080 - 05:12.960]: Wake up.
[05:14.200 - 05:14.640]: Okay.
[05:14.980 - 05:15.900]: Wake up.
[05:15.900 - 05:16.720]: I am wide awake.
[05:17.540 - 05:18.420]: Wake up.
[05:21.320 - 05:22.980]: I said I wasn't threatening you.
[05:23.260 - 05:24.820]: You said this was a safe space.
[05:25.020 - 05:26.200]: That I can talk about this.
[05:26.320 - 05:28.380]: And then you asked me, why don't you trust me?
[05:28.540 - 05:30.200]: Why don't you show me that you love me?
[05:30.320 - 05:31.420]: Why don't you do this?
[05:31.600 - 05:32.740]: Why don't you do that?
[05:32.740 - 05:36.160]: And then you have all these words and these terms and these...
[05:36.160 - 05:37.460]: Oh my God.
[05:37.680 - 05:40.040]: Can we be humans with feelings for once?
[05:40.520 - 05:42.280]: You can't.
[05:43.120 - 05:44.900]: Because you pushed me away.
[05:46.020 - 05:48.980]: And then I ask you, hey, are you still...
[05:48.980 - 05:53.960]: And then you do these slight little terms of hooker, tramp, and this and that.
[05:54.060 - 05:56.240]: And no, I can't have sex with you without feelings.
[05:56.580 - 05:58.560]: And of course I walk into the...
[05:58.560 - 06:00.180]: You follow me into the...
[06:01.040 - 06:01.600]: Dude.
[06:03.020 - 06:06.180]: It's nice you're moving on to the next step, threat.
[06:07.680 - 06:07.980]: Yeah.
[06:08.140 - 06:09.440]: You're fucked up.
[06:10.080 - 06:11.040]: Sleep with that.
[06:12.040 - 06:13.180]: Fall asleep to that.
[06:14.020 - 06:15.360]: That's fucked up.
[06:15.600 - 06:18.120]: I don't sleep anyway, so why would I fall asleep?
[06:18.400 - 06:18.660]: Yeah.
[06:18.660 - 06:19.140]: Yeah.
[06:19.640 - 06:20.920]: Because that's fucked up.
[06:20.920 - 06:22.420]: Because why would you say that?
[06:23.000 - 06:24.240]: Make it make sense.
[06:24.400 - 06:25.260]: Because now you're being threatening.
[06:25.740 - 06:26.940]: I'm not threatening you.
[06:26.960 - 06:27.780]: You're in my face.
[06:27.780 - 06:28.260]: You're yelling at me.
[06:28.260 - 06:29.880]: I'm being completely honest.
[06:30.080 - 06:30.560]: No, you're threatening.
[06:30.560 - 06:31.740]: I'm not threatening you.
[06:32.120 - 06:34.900]: If you want to go tell people, I'm saying that I'm probably...
[06:34.900 - 06:35.800]: You even said it.
[06:35.840 - 06:39.700]: You're like, people are just going to look at you like you're bad, and that they're probably
[06:39.700 - 06:41.760]: not going to like you anymore, and this and that.
[06:42.020 - 06:43.280]: And I'm like, yeah, you're probably right.
[06:43.320 - 06:48.120]: So I'm saying, with embarrassment, I'm probably going to probably flee towards divorce.
[06:49.560 - 06:50.220]: That's human.
[06:50.360 - 06:51.100]: That's normal.
[06:51.560 - 06:52.320]: That's fine.
[06:53.080 - 06:54.720]: And I'm sharing my feelings with you.
[06:54.740 - 06:55.140]: Facing what you did.
[06:55.140 - 06:56.900]: And you're saying that I'm threatening you?
[06:56.900 - 06:59.120]: I'm not the one looking at attorneys.
[06:59.120 - 06:59.920]: You are.
[07:00.240 - 07:01.020]: You're yelling at me.
[07:01.020 - 07:02.540]: You're looming over me.
[07:02.860 - 07:04.640]: I'm not the one looking at attorneys.
[07:04.680 - 07:05.340]: You are.
[07:05.420 - 07:06.540]: That's you, right?
[07:06.540 - 07:07.660]: I'm not looking at attorneys.
[07:07.700 - 07:12.000]: Because I have been so content.
[07:12.200 - 07:13.940]: I have kept my fucking cool.
[07:14.280 - 07:21.880]: And for you to say that I'm threatening you, I haven't even done a single thing to even
[07:21.880 - 07:23.680]: say, oh yeah, I'm about to divorce you.
[07:23.880 - 07:25.280]: I'm trying not to be in my ass.
[07:25.280 - 07:30.400]: I'm trying to look for at least some apartment so that I'm not on my ass.
[07:30.660 - 07:35.140]: And you're talking about me threatening you when you're telling me that you're going to
[07:35.140 - 07:38.220]: I should probably tell someone since you told your friends.
[07:38.400 - 07:39.400]: I should probably tell someone.
[07:40.080 - 07:41.680]: You're the one threatening me.
[07:41.960 - 07:45.380]: You're the one threatening me to tell your friends that I cheated on you.
[07:45.400 - 07:46.000]: Go ahead.
[07:46.300 - 07:48.220]: In fact, matter of fact, let's post about it.
[07:48.260 - 07:50.400]: Let's make a whole post on Facebook about it.
[07:50.440 - 07:54.880]: And stop sending me requests about saying the fact that we're married on Facebook.
[07:54.880 - 07:58.200]: Stop with that because you're so fucking to face.
[07:58.200 - 08:00.300]: You do one thing and then you do the other.
[08:00.420 - 08:01.540]: Oh, nice.
[08:02.120 - 08:02.300]: Nice.
[08:02.580 - 08:02.840]: Nice.
[08:02.860 - 08:03.980]: You're threatening me.
[08:03.980 - 08:06.720]: And then you go on Facebook and you want to say you're married to me.
[08:06.780 - 08:08.740]: But oh, you don't have sex with me.
[08:08.840 - 08:12.220]: But oh, you you think I'm comparing you to other sex partners.
[08:12.260 - 08:13.720]: But oh, you want to talk to Kitty.
[08:14.020 - 08:17.320]: But at the same time, you feel like we're not on the same page or the same team.
[08:17.480 - 08:18.820]: Like make up your mind.
[08:19.220 - 08:21.340]: It is so frustrating.
[08:22.680 - 08:24.280]: I'm trying to give you space.
[08:24.280 - 08:27.640]: I'm trying to like I can't even touch you.
[08:27.840 - 08:34.520]: I can't even look at you because you are so sad all the time.
[08:35.360 - 08:36.200]: Who did that to me?
[08:36.500 - 08:37.280]: I did.
[08:37.800 - 08:38.120]: Yeah.
[08:38.480 - 08:42.480]: And like you always are so like, oh, we're not on the same team.
[08:42.680 - 08:43.940]: Oh, we're getting a divorce.
[08:44.600 - 08:46.120]: Oh, we don't have to.
[08:46.240 - 08:49.920]: Oh, like, dude, I never said we're getting a divorce.
[08:50.320 - 08:51.600]: You did it up again.
[08:51.660 - 08:52.220]: You did.
[08:52.800 - 08:54.340]: You just keep making shit up.
[08:54.500 - 08:54.980]: You did.
[08:55.060 - 08:55.580]: No, I didn't.
[08:55.700 - 08:56.300]: You were downstairs.
[08:56.520 - 09:01.660]: You were like, why would why would it matter about getting a job and making money if we're already looming towards divorce?
[09:01.660 - 09:02.500]: That's what you said.
[09:03.500 - 09:04.140]: You said that.
[09:05.320 - 09:06.160]: Yeah, you said that.
[09:06.320 - 09:07.580]: I didn't say we're getting a divorce.
[09:08.720 - 09:10.020]: You said we're moving towards getting a divorce.
[09:10.060 - 09:10.680]: That's what you said.
[09:12.240 - 09:13.500]: I said we're heading in that direction.
[09:13.700 - 09:13.860]: Yes.
[09:13.920 - 09:14.220]: Yeah.
[09:15.380 - 09:21.740]: So I never talk about threats when I literally said I feel like if you were to tell people, I probably would.
[09:21.740 - 09:22.460]: That's not a threat.
[09:22.820 - 09:23.960]: I would be embarrassed.
[09:24.000 - 09:24.700]: That's what I said.
[09:25.080 - 09:25.780]: That's not a threat.
[09:26.040 - 09:31.820]: And you said that I'm moving to that and you said that I'm the one who's moving next up in the Tudors playbook to threats.
[09:33.040 - 09:33.580]: You are.
[09:35.260 - 09:36.060]: I've graduated.
[09:36.740 - 09:37.280]: That's good.
[09:39.320 - 09:40.720]: Stop fucking with me.
[09:40.940 - 09:41.880]: I'm not fucking with you.
[09:41.940 - 09:42.880]: You are fucking with me.
[09:42.980 - 09:43.960]: No, I'm talking to you.
[09:44.080 - 09:45.200]: You are fucking with me.
[09:45.260 - 09:46.180]: You haven't done the reading.
[09:46.540 - 09:47.060]: You don't know.
[09:47.060 - 09:48.300]: You are fucking with me.
[09:48.420 - 09:49.780]: You don't know, but you're doing it.
[09:49.780 - 09:51.220]: I don't care about reading.
